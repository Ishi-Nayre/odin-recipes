    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol>
        <h4>For the Meat Sauce</h4>
        <li>In a large pot over medium heat, bring about 4 quarts salted water to a boil. Add lasagna noodles and cook for about 1 to 2 minutes less than package directions Rinse under cold running water and drain well.</li>
        <h4> For the Meat Sauce</h4>
        <li>In a large thick-bottomed pot over medium heat, heat oil. Add sliced hotdogs and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 1 to 2 minutes or until lightly browned. With a slotted spoon, remove from pan and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Add onions and garlic and cook until softened. </li>
        <li>Add bell peppers and cook until softened.</li>
        <li>Add ground beef and cook, stirring occasionally and breaking into small pieces, for about 7 to 10 minutes until lightly browned. Drain excess fat, if any.</li>
        <li>Add tomato sauce, tomato paste, ketchup, and beef broth. Stir in sugar and Italian seasoning. Bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Lower heat, cover and simmer for about 35 to 45 minutes or until meat is fully cooked and sauce is slightly thickened.</li>
        <li>During the last 10 minutes of cooking, add browned hotdogs. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <h7>For the Bechamel Sauce</h7>
        <li>In a large saucepan over medium heat, melt butter. </li>
        <li>Add flour and stir well into a smooth paste. Cook, stirring regularly, for about 1 to 2 minutes or until golden (but NOT browned) and starts to bubble a bit.</li>
        <li>Slowly add milk in a thin stream, whisking vigorously until the mixture is very smooth and lump-free.</li>
        <li>Continue to cook, whisking regularly, for about 4 to 5 minutes or until thick but pourable. The sauce should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.
        </li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>

        <h4>Assembly</h4>
        <li>Grease bottom and sides of a large baking dish with nonstick cooking spray. </li>
        <li>Ladle about ½ cup of meat sauce and spread it to cover the bottom of the dish. 
        </li>
        <li>Ladle bechamel sauce over the meat sauce and gently spread across.</li>
        <li>Arrange one layer of lasagna noodles lengthwise over the white sauce. Cut a piece of lasagna to fit into gaps as needed. </li>
        <li>Ladle a third of the remaining meat sauce over the noodles and spread across the surface.</li>
        <li>Ladle another layer of white sauce over the meat sauce</li>
        <li>Finish with a third layer of noodles, meat sauce, and bechamel.
        </li>
        <li>Sprinkle shredded cheese over the top and last layer of bechamel sauce.
        </li>
        <li>Tent the lasagna pan with foil and bake in a 375 oven for about 30 to 40 minutes or until completely heated through and cheese is melted. </li>
        <li>Remove from heat and allow to rest for about 15 to 20 minutes before cutting.</li>
    
        <h4>NOTES</h4>
        <li>Stick a few toothpicks into the assembled pasta to elevate the foil and keep it from sticking to the cheese layer.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna rest uncovered for at least 15 minutes before cutting for neater slices.</li>
    </ol>
